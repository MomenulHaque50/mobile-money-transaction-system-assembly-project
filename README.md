# mobile-money-transaction-system-assembly-project
16bit micropocessor 8086 software project.
To run use EMU8086 emulator.

Some important information:

i) In this project, no multiple digit addition or suntraction apply for balance calculation to measure complexity of the project.

ii) If you want to implement it and ask for help from me, then contact me via mail: mominulhaquemim13@gmail.com

iii) I only just focus on basic interface design.

iv) Here, I choose bKash (popular transaction system in BD) as a basic system.

v) In this project balance system is static. For implementation I choose this sequence, Send Money-100 -> Send Money to non-user-100 -> Recharge- 50 -> Payment- 100 -> Cash out- 200 and my starting balance is 1000 taka.

vi) You can design your static design.

vii) Password system is dynamic. You can change whatever you like.

Thank you! Happy Coding!
